<p>17<br>00:01:41,060 –&gt; 00:01:51,140<br>The The 2nd test is practice, practical driving dragon. </p>
<p>18<br>00:01:51,180 –&gt; 00:02:02,070<br>Both the 2nd and the 3rd and the forces are also a paper, yeah, written test.</p>
<p>19<br>00:02:04,550 –&gt; 00:02:09,550<br>But but what is different about this 2nd test?</p>
<p>20<br>00:02:09,970 –&gt; 00:02:16,460<br>Like, it’s not about the the laws and the signs and transportation, what’s it about?</p>
<p>21<br>00:02:16,580 –&gt; 00:02:21,660<br>Are you mean the force, or the 2nd, the 3rd?</p>
<p>22<br>00:02:22,150 –&gt; 00:02:24,890<br>The 3rd test, which is a written test?</p>
<p>23<br>00:02:25,050 –&gt; 00:02:29,790<br>You said you take a written test, a driving test, and then another written test, right?</p>
<p>24<br>00:02:29,960 –&gt; 00:02:36,980<br>Or no? Therefore two answer is a both a practical test.</p>
<p>25<br>00:02:37,510 –&gt; 00:02:44,070<br>Oh, okay. Okay. So so you take two driving tests into written tests?</p>
<p>26<br>00:02:44,230 –&gt; 00:03:02,390<br>Yeah, okay. And and for the um, for the driving test, do you only stay, like, inside a track or something they like make, or do you go out on the road?</p>
<p>27<br>00:03:03,040 –&gt; 00:03:09,240<br>I know there is one part I need to go on the railroad.</p>
<p>28<br>00:03:10,530 –&gt; 00:03:13,090<br>Okay. Okay. Okay. So you haven’t done it yet.</p>
<p>29<br>00:03:13,610 –&gt; 00:03:17,050<br>Could I just pass past the 1st test?</p>
<p>30<br>00:03:17,420 –&gt; 00:03:21,660<br>And now he did training training for the 2nd test.</p>
<p>31<br>00:03:21,740 –&gt; 00:03:24,180<br>The 2nd test is most tough, actually.</p>
<p>32<br>00:03:25,000 –&gt; 00:03:33,320<br>Okay. Okay. Oh, okay. Okay. So do you think that the written test or the driving test will be more difficult?</p>
<p>33<br>00:03:35,000 –&gt; 00:03:43,980<br>I don’t the the 1st time, actually, there 2000, uh, choice questions.</p>
<p>34<br>00:03:44,660 –&gt; 00:03:47,560<br>2nd Oh, oh, right, right, right, yeah, great.</p>
<p>35<br>00:03:47,580 –&gt; 00:03:50,480<br>Me. Yes. So you have to study a lot, yeah.</p>
<p>36<br>00:03:50,640 –&gt; 00:03:55,560<br>And they would pick 100 questions.</p>
<p>37<br>00:03:55,900 –&gt; 00:04:03,820<br>If you can, uh, get right, nine, 9090 questions, then you can answer.</p>
<p>38<br>00:04:03,980 –&gt; 00:04:08,610<br>1st off. It’s not, not not very okay.</p>
<p>39<br>00:04:08,770 –&gt; 00:04:15,710<br>I understand, I understand in the in the US, we also have a written test and driving test.</p>
<p>40<br>00:04:15,930 –&gt; 00:04:21,690<br>And in the state that I’m from, you have to take a course.</p>
<p>41<br>00:04:22,430 –&gt; 00:04:25,530<br>Like, you can’t just take the test and drive.</p>
<p>42<br>00:04:25,690 –&gt; 00:04:27,430<br>You have to take A-A course.</p>
<p>43<br>00:04:27,710 –&gt; 00:04:31,400<br>Um, that’s like a few weeks long.</p>
<p>44<br>00:04:31,560 –&gt; 00:04:37,080<br>But, um, where I’m from, you can get your driver s license, like, really young.</p>
<p>45<br>00:04:37,360 –&gt; 00:04:40,020<br>So it’s really important they have that.</p>
<p>46<br>00:04:40,380 –&gt; 00:04:46,540<br>And, um, in the US, we always do the driving on, like, the regular road.</p>
<p>47<br>00:04:46,740 –&gt; 00:05:03,590<br>So when I got mine done, it was like, yeah, it was like highway driving in driving in town, you know, all it would be like both Um, ain’t The only reason it’s difficult sometimes is because you</p>
<p>48<br>00:05:03,800 –&gt; 00:05:08,390<br>have to remember to do everything exactly at the right</p>
<p>49<br>00:05:08,560 –&gt; 00:05:17,710<br>time. You know, like turn your turning signal on at the perfect time, you know, and start, like, breaking at the perfect time.</p>
<p>50<br>00:05:17,970 –&gt; 00:05:22,250<br>You know what I mean? I wouldn’t do that in</p>
<p>51<br>00:05:22,410 –&gt; 00:05:35,070<br>real life. But for the test you have in the past, I-I-I find the trick is there is a like operations chain.</p>
<p>52<br>00:05:36,550 –&gt; 00:05:45,340<br>You need to have, have a list, and then many things you should do them in order, and then you can pass the test.</p>
<p>53<br>00:05:45,500 –&gt; 00:05:53,710<br>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you have to do, um, parallel parking, get to your parallel parking?</p>
<p>54<br>00:05:54,260 –&gt; 00:05:59,480<br>I-I know, I know, yeah. Some people hate this part of the test.</p>
<p>55<br>00:06:01,590 –&gt; 00:06:07,390<br>Yesterday, I went to the training training court.</p>
<p>56<br>00:06:07,780 –&gt; 00:06:14,680<br>The one of my policy, one of my seniors was training this part.</p>
<p>57<br>00:06:14,790 –&gt; 00:06:20,470<br>One of your white seniors, like the students before me?</p>
<p>58<br>00:06:21,270 –&gt; 00:06:25,230<br>Oh, oh. Some other students. Okay.</p>
<p>59<br>00:06:25,490 –&gt; 00:06:27,470<br>Okay. They were working on that.</p>
<p>60<br>00:06:27,630 –&gt; 00:06:30,010<br>We have you. Have you done that before?</p>
<p>61<br>00:06:30,450 –&gt; 00:06:34,090<br>No, no, no. I Oh, you’ve never tried it?</p>
<p>62<br>00:06:35,770 –&gt; 00:07:12,450<br>Interesting. Okay, when when I was learning how to do my, uh, when I was learning how to drive, I was like 13 years old, um, and I-I, when I was younger, I lived in a small town, so my friend and I, once we actually learned how to drive, we would just drive without a driver’s license, because there are so many, like, like rural roads need where we live, you know.</p>
<p>63<br>00:07:12,710 –&gt; 00:07:14,510<br>And so we would just go do it.</p>
<p>64<br>00:07:14,670 –&gt; 00:07:24,620<br>But I feel like in the U-S it’s really common for, like, a paren’t, like one of your paren’ts, to teach you how to drive before you take the test.</p>
<p>65<br>00:07:24,790 –&gt; 00:07:28,130<br>Like, do paren’ts usually teach their kids how to drive in China?</p>
<p>66<br>00:07:28,290 –&gt; 00:07:38,900<br>Or No? Yes. Some some of my friends learn how to drive from their paren’ts.</p>
<p>67<br>00:07:40,460 –&gt; 00:07:43,080<br>Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, got it.</p>
<p>68<br>00:07:43,240 –&gt; 00:07:45,600<br>Yeah, it’s, it’s pretty much the same the US.</p>
<p>69<br>00:07:46,560 –&gt; 00:07:49,320<br>I’m really surprised you don’t have your driver s license?</p>
<p>70<br>00:07:50,760 –&gt; 00:07:55,410<br>Yeah. Do you like in the Oh, go ahead.</p>
<p>71<br>00:07:55,970 –&gt; 00:08:08,420<br>Most of my peers, they would got the driver license in the summer break of their graduation of high school.</p>
<p>72<br>00:08:09,730 –&gt; 00:08:15,650<br>That summer break, people don’t have anything to do.</p>
<p>73<br>00:08:16,550 –&gt; 00:08:19,670<br>Okay, then you’re going to enter the college.</p>
<p>74<br>00:08:21,750 –&gt; 00:08:25,230<br>I was not interested in it.</p>
<p>75<br>00:08:25,660 –&gt; 00:08:36,240<br>So are Yeah. If you don’t have a car, then there’s not really a recent like in the U-S-A lot of people who live in really big cities don’t have cars.</p>
<p>76<br>00:08:36,400 –&gt; 00:08:43,590<br>They just use public transportation or they walk because it’s easier and it’s really expensive to have a car when you live in the city.</p>
<p>77<br>00:08:43,590 –&gt; 00:08:46,590<br>So a lot of them won’t have drivers license.</p>
<p>78<br>00:08:46,700 –&gt; 00:08:54,800<br>But the people like me, who are not from really big cities, were always like, oh my gosh, you don’t have a driver’s license?</p>
<p>79<br>00:08:54,960 –&gt; 00:09:04,910<br>That’s crazy, like, because we have to use it so much without big cities with good public transportation, you know, a bad way.</p>
<p>80<br>00:09:05,070 –&gt; 00:09:09,570<br>What types, what? What types cars do you like?</p>
<p>81<br>00:09:10,550 –&gt; 00:09:12,990<br>Do I like, or do I have?</p>
<p>82<br>00:09:13,630 –&gt; 00:09:25,630<br>Do like them? Um, I like a lot of cars.</p>
<p>83<br>00:09:25,800 –&gt; 00:09:44,240<br>Um, I like, um, old Porsches, uh, portions, but, like, like, older already, once brand.</p>

<p>105<br>00:11:35,370 –&gt; 00:11:42,930<br>And it’s probably not very big, and it has a shape that makes it look like it will go fast, and kind of looks cool.</p>
<p>106<br>00:11:43,310 –&gt; 00:11:51,280<br>Yeah, this is they came in the other How do you call the car in the land light?</p>
<p>107<br>00:11:51,440 –&gt; 00:11:55,840<br>Like the land cruiser, lay in cruiser.</p>
<p>108<br>00:11:56,840 –&gt; 00:12:00,800<br>How do you call that kind that type cars?</p>
<p>109<br>00:12:00,960 –&gt; 00:12:02,920<br>Are, you mean for off roading?</p>
<p>110<br>00:12:04,160 –&gt; 00:12:10,240<br>Off roading? Like to drive off the road, like, um, on dirt or in the mountain.</p>
<p>111<br>00:12:11,280 –&gt; 00:12:13,660<br>I like this kind of car too.</p>
<p>112<br>00:12:13,820 –&gt; 00:12:16,650<br>We call this like, yeah, like off road.</p>
<p>113<br>00:12:16,770 –&gt; 00:12:21,130<br>So off road means that you’re driving, like, in the dirt or something.</p>
<p>114<br>00:12:21,230 –&gt; 00:12:34,340<br>So maybe this for this, you would have A-G class, which is Mercedes, you know, this car, I know, sea clocks from bands, yeah, from, yeah, we don’t call it bends.</p>
<p>115<br>00:12:34,500 –&gt; 00:12:38,190<br>We call it Mercedes. Yeah. I know.</p>
<p>116<br>00:12:38,350 –&gt; 00:12:41,670<br>I know in China, you guys say Bens, but we say Mercedes.</p>
<p>117<br>00:12:41,830 –&gt; 00:12:44,890<br>We don’t say Benz. You can say Mercedes, benz.</p>
<p>118<br>00:12:45,520 –&gt; 00:12:59,330<br>People will not understand if you just say that in the advertisement of the call, I’m what what we will call it the Mercedes Mercedes.</p>
<p>119<br>00:13:00,490 –&gt; 00:13:09,250<br>So there’s like the G class, which is a Mercedes bends, or there’s a Jeep Wrangler, you know, the Jeep Wrangler that’s also an off road car.</p>
<p>120<br>00:13:11,070 –&gt; 00:13:15,230<br>And then, um, there’s another one that I really like.</p>
<p>121<br>00:13:15,870 –&gt; 00:13:23,070<br>There’s, um, you know, like land Rover.</p>
<p>122<br>00:13:27,070 –&gt; 00:13:30,890<br>Okay. Okay. I like this one is Bronco.</p>
<p>123<br>00:13:31,050 –&gt; 00:13:35,270<br>Maybe I like Broncos too, you know, bronco.</p>
<p>124<br>00:13:38,390 –&gt; 00:13:52,370<br>Oh, yeah. They’re really cute. And I think a lot of these Bronco ones, they have, like, convertibles, so people make them into, like, really cute outdoor cars, you know, like this.</p>
<p>125<br>00:13:52,620 –&gt; 00:13:54,440<br>MM Look how cute that is.</p>
<p>126<br>00:13:54,640 –&gt; 00:14:07,780<br>That’s so cute. Okay, I like, oh, pattern Robert a Raptor, but that’s a truck, right?</p>
<p>127<br>00:14:07,860 –&gt; 00:14:10,660<br>Oh, yeah. It’s very lucky truck.</p>
<p>128<br>00:14:10,660 –&gt; 00:14:17,650<br>Yeah, yeah. So the the rafter truck is, like, I think that’s Ford.</p>
<p>129<br>00:14:17,910 –&gt; 00:14:20,690<br>In Ford is a very American company.</p>
<p>130<br>00:14:22,160 –&gt; 00:14:29,930<br>Of course. Of course, in the US, we have a lot of these, and, I know, in China, like pick up trucks.</p>
<p>131<br>00:14:30,090 –&gt; 00:14:35,130<br>So this type of truck is called the pick Pickup.</p>
<p>132<br>00:14:35,290 –&gt; 00:14:37,890<br>Yeah. Pick Yeah, pick up truck.</p>
<p>133<br>00:14:38,150 –&gt; 00:14:44,170<br>So this, this kind of truck in the US is so common, obviously, so common.</p>
<p>134<br>00:14:44,330 –&gt; 00:14:50,350<br>But I know in Asia, people just have them, like to look cool.</p>
<p>135<br>00:14:50,360 –&gt; 00:14:58,640<br>I-I think that in Asia, they are just like very cool cars, but much bigger than a lot of the cars other people have.</p>
<p>136<br>00:14:58,690 –&gt; 00:15:14,670<br>But in the US, people who have trucks, they usually want to use the truck for some work, or maybe they live,</p>
<p>137<br>00:15:14,950 –&gt; 00:15:29,950<br>yeah, or maybe they carry things, or maybe they like to build something, and so they like to put the tools and stuff in the back, or, um, uh, my dad has a truck, and I use his truck</p>
<p>138<br>00:15:30,020 –&gt; 00:15:36,620<br>for all of my plants, because I do, I make my paren’ts garden for them.</p>
<p>139<br>00:15:36,700 –&gt; 00:15:47,240<br>And so when I make their garden for them, I put, like, when I go buy plants, or all of the dirt or the rocks, then I put them all on the back of the truck and drive home.</p>
<p>140<br>00:15:47,620 –&gt; 00:15:54,190<br>Yeah, so you more how to save you you make it more functional.</p>
<p>141<br>00:15:54,490 –&gt; 00:16:01,100<br>But, yeah, more functional. It’s more functional in the U-S, yeah.</p>
<p>142<br>00:16:01,260 –&gt; 00:16:19,390<br>A recently China, one of company companies in China, long how to release a new release, a new car called a, maybe you can in China.</p>
<p>143<br>00:16:19,550 –&gt; 00:16:25,260<br>1st. Yeah, it’s like G-P it’s more cheaper.</p>
<p>144<br>00:16:26,740 –&gt; 00:16:30,440<br>Oh, it’s, it’s cheaper. You don’t have to say more cheaper.</p>
<p>145<br>00:16:30,600 –&gt; 00:16:32,920<br>Remember, your Super means more cheap.</p>
<p>146<br>00:16:32,940 –&gt; 00:16:35,820<br>Yeah, so it’s cheaper than a cheap.</p>
<p>147<br>00:16:36,040 –&gt; 00:16:39,260<br>Ah, you know what this looks like?</p>
<p>148<br>00:16:39,420 –&gt; 00:16:43,840<br>This looks like, um, this looks like a Jimmy, you know, jimmy?</p>
<p>149<br>00:16:47,620 –&gt; 00:16:53,620<br>Oh, I don’t know. Okay, yeah, it’s a suzuki.</p>
<p>150<br>00:16:55,540 –&gt; 00:17:01,140<br>As Jimmy is Suzuki, which, you say, japanese brand?</p>
<p>151<br>00:17:01,220 –&gt; 00:17:10,980<br>Ah, tank 300. So, what, um, what car brand is this?</p>
<p>152<br>00:17:13,940 –&gt; 00:17:15,240<br>I don’t know. I doesn’t know.</p>
<p>153<br>00:17:15,300 –&gt; 00:17:21,890<br>This brands name. It looks fine, it looks good.</p>
<p>154<br>00:17:22,580 –&gt; 00:17:29,680<br>Yeah, it’s actually, it’s a ability, I like, like, jeep.</p>
<p>155<br>00:17:29,840 –&gt; 00:17:36,290<br>But, oh, yes, very venture, really, okay, cool.</p>
<p>156<br>00:17:36,550 –&gt; 00:17:38,870<br>I just don’t even know, like, what brand this is.</p>
<p>157<br>00:17:39,030 –&gt; 00:17:41,580<br>All I see is take 10th 300.</p>
<p>158<br>00:17:41,880 –&gt; 00:17:44,060<br>Is it like from the government or something?</p>
<p>159<br>00:17:44,440 –&gt; 00:17:51,250<br>Or is it G-G-W-M Great Wall motor this?</p>
<p>160<br>00:17:51,410 –&gt; 00:17:55,870<br>This is the brand? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>161<br>00:17:56,030 –&gt; 00:17:59,550<br>Okay. Okay. I never heard of it, obviously.</p>
<p>162<br>00:17:59,930 –&gt; 00:18:07,230<br>Wait. So China doesn’t, china doesn t export GWM cars.</p>
<p>163<br>00:18:08,390 –&gt; 00:18:12,230<br>I’ve never seen them before. So they are only in China.</p>
<p>164<br>00:18:13,160 –&gt; 00:18:20,240<br>I don’t know if it’s, if it export, maybe it’s not very popular.</p>
<p>165<br>00:18:22,010 –&gt; 00:18:24,130<br>Yeah, I’ve never seen it before.</p>
<p>166<br>00:18:25,490 –&gt; 00:18:28,890<br>I think it’d be really fun to have an off roading car.</p>
<p>167<br>00:18:29,050 –&gt; 00:18:30,210<br>Do you like to offer it?</p>
<p>168<br>00:18:30,270 –&gt; 00:18:31,750<br>Have you ever done that before?</p>
<p>169<br>00:18:32,630 –&gt; 00:18:40,220<br>I don’t, but I want to firstly have a coverwood Urban.</p>
<p>170<br>00:18:40,380 –&gt; 00:18:52,320<br>Carvers, yeah, yeah, yeah, right. Normal car, like, like a sit down, sit down, this kind of car.</p>
<p>171<br>00:18:52,400 –&gt; 00:19:03,820<br>Ah, then it’s long. A sedan, A sedan is just gone.</p>
<p>172<br>00:19:07,060 –&gt; 00:19:19,300<br>And then buy a off land out of offloading road, offroad, the offroad car, and, okay, and then buy a, maybe family card.</p>
<p>173<br>00:19:19,300 –&gt; 00:19:23,300<br>There are many, yeah, maybe, like an SUV.</p>
<p>174<br>00:19:23,630 –&gt; 00:19:25,830<br>We will call this like an SUV.</p>
<p>175<br>00:19:26,590 –&gt; 00:19:31,000<br>SUV stands more for utility vehicle.</p>
<p>176<br>00:19:31,360 –&gt; 00:19:36,800<br>In an SUV usually has, like, quite a few seats.</p>
<p>177<br>00:19:37,190 –&gt; 00:19:49,060<br>It’s good for families. I’ve been bigger than S-U-V is, like, I would like being like this, not like this.</p>
<p>178<br>00:19:50,020 –&gt; 00:19:53,730<br>These are, these are Suvs. Yeah, yeah, I know.</p>
<p>179<br>00:19:53,890 –&gt; 00:20:08,150<br>But bigger than it? Like, like, um, business card, you know, business card cars.</p>
<p>180<br>00:20:08,270 –&gt; 00:20:13,430<br>What’s a business car? Um, bigger than this?</p>
<p>181<br>00:20:13,650 –&gt; 00:20:21,660<br>What I can think of is like, oh, what did Lincoln Navigator?</p>
<p>182<br>00:20:23,100 –&gt; 00:20:27,670<br>No, no, no, not that. Cause that’s huge.</p>
<p>183<br>00:20:29,240 –&gt; 00:20:31,800<br>Why do I need such a huge car?</p>
<p>184<br>00:20:32,100 –&gt; 00:20:36,800<br>Like, when you say a bigger car, you mean, like this big, that is so big.</p>
<p>185<br>00:20:37,190 –&gt; 00:20:37,670<br>How many kids</p>
<p>186<br>00:20:38,030 –&gt; 00:20:44,650<br>do you plan to have? No, it’s just my plan.</p>
<p>187<br>00:20:46,480 –&gt; 00:20:50,060<br>But a car that big is crazy.</p>
<p>188<br>00:20:50,220 –&gt; 00:20:52,820<br>Like, that’s more difficult to drive everywhere.</p>
<p>189<br>00:20:52,980 –&gt; 00:20:55,360<br>Aren’t the roads in China very small?</p>
<p>190<br>00:20:55,630 –&gt; 00:21:03,910<br>Yeah, oh, do you know, world War How do you call it?</p>
<p>191<br>00:21:04,230 –&gt; 00:21:15,940<br>Will a Volvo? Bob? Yes, it’s very popular in college.</p>
<p>192<br>00:21:16,160 –&gt; 00:21:27,360<br>Don’t in college, yeah, cause it’s, I don’t know why, uh, uh, maybe you know, it’s feature is safety.</p>
<p>193<br>00:21:27,680 –&gt; 00:21:34,620<br>So many professors? Yeah, we’ll, we’ll buy it.</p>
<p>194<br>00:21:35,040 –&gt; 00:21:47,010<br>I don’t know why that is so funny in the US, like, people think of Volvo as like an older person car because it has so many safety features.</p>
<p>195<br>00:21:47,170 –&gt; 00:21:49,750<br>And usually older people care about that more.</p>
<p>196<br>00:21:49,920 –&gt; 00:21:52,580<br>You know, younger people just care about, like, how it looks.</p>
<p>197<br>00:21:52,940 –&gt; 00:21:56,180<br>So usually, like older people have fall though.</p>
<p>198<br>00:21:58,050 –&gt; 00:22:07,010<br>But I-I recently my boyfriend loves cars, and so he’ll show me a lot of cars all the time.</p>
<p>199<br>00:22:07,230 –&gt; 00:22:23,680<br>And the past few years, I’ve loved Volvo, because I think they don’t just have safety features, they just have a lot of features that are really good quality and really good, like, really good technology, you know, like, very comfortable.</p>
<p>200<br>00:22:24,020 –&gt; 00:22:33,910<br>It’s safe, but it’s also, like, very, very comfortable and easy, you know, I think I would get a ball though, if I could get a car right now.</p>
<p>201<br>00:22:35,150 –&gt; 00:22:45,960<br>Yeah, um. So when you get, you said that you plan to get, like, a sedan, like a commuting car.</p>
<p>202<br>00:22:45,960 –&gt; 00:22:49,080<br>So what, what kind of car do you like?</p>
<p>203<br>00:22:49,460 –&gt; 00:22:51,480<br>Like, what kind of car do you think you’d get?</p>
<p>204<br>00:22:51,900 –&gt; 00:23:04,770<br>Uh, I don’t know. Abroad by in China, there are, there are three out three cars in innocent.</p>
<p>205<br>00:23:04,850 –&gt; 00:23:11,160<br>Same level is, I do know, audio, adi.</p>
<p>206<br>00:23:11,320 –&gt; 00:23:15,490<br>Adi. It’s a German brand W-A.</p>
<p>207<br>00:23:15,650 –&gt; 00:23:28,410<br>Six and, oh, five. And my, my Ben, is, how do you call ben?</p>
<p>208<br>00:23:29,140 –&gt; 00:23:46,350<br>Mercedes? Mercedes A, not B-W-M-B-M-W-E-E class, we would call it, we would call it E class.</p>
<p>209<br>00:23:46,730 –&gt; 00:23:54,590<br>So for your savings, yeah, we say E class, or or C class or G class.</p>
<p>210<br>00:24:00,550 –&gt; 00:24:04,190<br>Okay, so B-M-W, five, I don’t know what that looks like.</p>
<p>211<br>00:24:04,710 –&gt; 00:24:09,590<br>Oh, five series. Yeah. So the same with, same with BMW.</p>
<p>212<br>00:24:10,010 –&gt; 00:24:18,660<br>They say series for theirs. So you would think all I’ve series, R-B-M-W, five series, but our outy is correct, you just say a six.</p>
<p>213<br>00:24:19,910 –&gt; 00:24:27,840<br>So I-I think one of my students told me that Audi is really popular, um, in Beijing?</p>
<p>214<br>00:24:28,000 –&gt; 00:24:37,150<br>Oh, it’s, I don’t know now, but in the past is it’s cars for the government?</p>
<p>215<br>00:24:37,790 –&gt; 00:24:42,520<br>Oh, like the What? But that’s, it’s a German brand, right?</p>
<p>216<br>00:24:42,680 –&gt; 00:24:44,320<br>Oh, oh, oh no. You’re right.</p>
<p>217<br>00:24:44,480 –&gt; 00:24:51,300<br>That’s what she told me. She told me that government officials use that car.</p>
<p>218<br>00:24:51,420 –&gt; 00:24:54,420<br>True. True. True. Yes, that’s what she told me.</p>
<p>219<br>00:24:54,620 –&gt; 00:24:59,320<br>Okay, so so other people wanted to buy it after that.</p>
<p>220<br>00:24:59,880 –&gt; 00:25:06,610<br>Maybe, I think, maybe really. Okay, that’s funny, yeah, but I think it’s a good car, though.</p>
<p>221<br>00:25:06,650 –&gt; 00:25:11,650<br>It’s nice Outie makes a lot of, like, like kind of luxury cars.</p>
<p>222<br>00:25:11,810 –&gt; 00:25:17,670<br>They’re like, um, they’re like commuter cars, you know, like commuter, like going to work.</p>
<p>223<br>00:25:17,950 –&gt; 00:25:25,590<br>They are called them commuter cars, but they’re really comfortable.</p>
<p>224<br>00:25:26,040 –&gt; 00:25:34,440<br>But now there are some new new energy cars companies in China, which are also popular.</p>
<p>225<br>00:25:34,570 –&gt; 00:25:54,850<br>Cause new energy electric there in new companies, but they have different I ideology of constructing cars.</p>
<p>226<br>00:25:55,170 –&gt; 00:25:59,970<br>Oh, okay, cool. Like Internet companies.</p>
<p>227<br>00:26:00,270 –&gt; 00:26:13,050<br>So many technology. Ah, yeah. And before you think that you would get one of those, maybe, I don’t know now, cause I don’t know too much about them.</p>
<p>228<br>00:26:13,530 –&gt; 00:26:18,490<br>Maybe we are well, but when I buy it, I will know more above them.</p>
<p>229<br>00:26:18,490 –&gt; 00:26:23,610<br>Right? Right, right. I have a lot of friends who have Teslas.</p>
<p>230<br>00:26:24,030 –&gt; 00:26:31,950<br>Oh, do people drive Tesla China in the singer devices of Teslas?</p>
<p>231<br>00:26:32,320 –&gt; 00:26:37,300<br>Oh, I heard of they’re not very convenient.</p>
<p>232<br>00:26:37,300 –&gt; 00:26:41,860<br>We call that like software. And I agree.</p>
<p>233<br>00:26:42,020 –&gt; 00:26:51,120<br>I’ve heard that. My friends have told me that the the friends that I have who have a Tesla say that it’s the suffer is really annoying to use.</p>
<p>234<br>00:26:51,190 –&gt; 00:27:08,980<br>And I also have a few friends who, or one friend who said there Tesla has broken down, like, multiple times, and it’s much more difficult to get, like, fast help for a Tesla, you know, than it is other cars.</p>
<p>235<br>00:27:08,980 –&gt; 00:27:14,100<br>Yeah, yeah, but that depends where you live too.</p>
<p>236<br>00:27:14,370 –&gt; 00:27:17,290<br>Like, different cities have different resources for Tesla.</p>
<p>237<br>00:27:17,450 –&gt; 00:27:23,350<br>So I don’t know what it’s like in China, but I imagine, like a lot of people would drive electric cars in China.</p>
<p>238<br>00:27:23,460 –&gt; 00:27:29,940<br>Yeah. Like, do you feel like it’s becoming really popular, very popular?</p>
<p>239<br>00:27:30,260 –&gt; 00:27:33,640<br>Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I mean, that makes sense to me.</p>
<p>240<br>00:27:33,940 –&gt; 00:27:44,970<br>Oh, yeah, yeah. Mm. But do you, um, once you get a car, do you think that, um, like, that’s just for when you go to Beijing?</p>
<p>241<br>00:27:45,250 –&gt; 00:27:47,110<br>Is that why you want it?</p>
<p>242<br>00:27:47,210 –&gt; 00:27:58,990<br>It’s, it’s so it’s not convenient driving the traffic is, beijing is very famous for crazy traffic.</p>
<p>243<br>00:27:59,200 –&gt; 00:28:02,740<br>But, but then, but you’re about to move to Beijing, right?</p>
<p>244<br>00:28:03,120 –&gt; 00:28:05,860<br>You’re almost going there a mile.</p>
<p>245<br>00:28:06,290 –&gt; 00:28:10,230<br>But my next stop, please, nanjing.</p>
<p>246<br>00:28:10,390 –&gt; 00:28:16,810<br>Maybe at that time I would, oh, really, could my girlfriend going there?</p>
<p>247<br>00:28:17,650 –&gt; 00:28:24,740<br>Don’t after, because my girlfriend will do her phd in Nanjing University.</p>
<p>248<br>00:28:24,760 –&gt; 00:28:28,480<br>Ah, okay. I understand. I understand.</p>
<p>249<br>00:28:28,960 –&gt; 00:28:32,500<br>Okay. So that’s really far from home still.</p>
